Data_Analysis_ Cohort3_Task1
# Introduction
According to the course requirement in the data analysis cohort 3, 2023  which Promise Chinoso is handling, I was required of me to create a table list of imaginary company employees with the under-listed features: 
-Employees’ ID
-Employees’ Full Name
-Department
-Salary
-Job type
# Students Activities
Show the following from the table generated:
1. Employees who are working as freelancers and earning above $10,000.
2. Split the employees' full names into first names and last names, highlighting any form of duplicate value in the table.
3. Highlight employees whose names start with E in yellow color, and highlight the highest salary value in green and the lowest salary value in red.
# Skills Involved
1. Analytical skills
2. Data Manipulation Skills
3. Use of Filter Function n
4. Use of Delimiter Function
5. Use of Conditional Formatting skills
# Data Set

As regards the first activity, I added a filter function to the employees’ table and filtered the job type column to Freelancer only. Among the freelancers, I had to highlight in red those whose salaries were above the threshold of  $10000 as shown below.

Also for the next activity, I split the employees’ full names into first and last name columns using the Delimiter function on the data tool Excel ribbon. After this, I checked for duplicate using the duplicate function and fortunately, there was none as revealed by the table below.

Lastly on the task, to highlight the employees whose names began with the letter “E”, I used the filter function again to filter to only the employees whose names are thus described above and highlighted them using the yellow ink as displayed below.

Summarily, we can see that of the seven(7) Freelancing employees, three of the earned below the threshold of $10000. Also only two employees’ have they began with the letter “E”. Lastly contract and Freelancing employees’ earned the highest salary of $25000.
In conclusion, I want to recommend that the salary of the part-time staff be reviewed to match that of other staff in the company.
