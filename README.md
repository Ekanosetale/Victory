As regards the first activity, I added a filter function to the employees’ table and filtered the job type column to Freelancer only. Among the freelancers, I had to highlight in red those whose salaries were above the threshold of  $10000 as shown below.

Also for the next activity, I split the employees’ full names into first and last name columns using the Delimiter function on the data tool Excel ribbon. After this, I checked for duplicate using the duplicate function and fortunately, there was none as revealed by the table below.
